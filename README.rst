What is CloudsStorm?
--------------------

CloudsStorm is a framework for managing an application-defined infrastructure among public IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) Clouds. It enables the application to customize its underlying infrastructure at software development phase and dynamically control it at operation phase. To be specific, the advantages and features are as follows:     

* **Programmable**: The underlying Cloud virtual infrastructure can be customized and programmed at software development phase to fit the application requirements. Furthermore, the connection topology with a private network can also be defined in advance.

* **Controllable**: CloudsStorm leverages the minimal function provided by Cloud and affords high-level controllability, including failure recovery, auto-scaling, etc. Therefore, the infrastructure can be easily controlled by the application at operation phase.

* **Interoperable**: CloudsStorm is able to manage virtual infrastructure among federated Clouds. Hence, this is not a vendor lock-in solution.  

* **Reusable**: We propose "infrastructure code" to describe dynamic operations on the infrastructure, instead of only static infrastructure description or deployment plan. It is able to define and automate all processes including provisioning, deploying, executing and releasing. This code is reusable and the entire process is reproducible, as long as you have a budget to access the Cloud.
